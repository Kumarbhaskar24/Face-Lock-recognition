Getting Started

Libraries/Tools

•	dlib (Version: 19.19.0)

•	face-recognition

•	flask

•	cs50

•	requests 

python version 3.8.10

How it works:

So, first installed the libraries which are given above and for ease of the user I have also mentioned libraries requirements in “requirement.txt” you can simply look over that

I have used dlib 19.19.0 version, So, if you are facing difficulty in installing dlib so I will suggest to install it on python 3.8 

After installing the required libraries firstly run helpers.py so that they get executed once and after that just run Flask application.py it will run on localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000 then open it and use it.
